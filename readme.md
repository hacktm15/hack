# FestivalTracker#
 

This webapp will make your life easier if you plan to go to a Festival.

What we basically offer here is tracking of festivals based on geographic area, date and cost. See all of them together and pick the one that fits you the most.

Why are we different from others seller sites? We don`t sell, we just gather information from other sites with direct link and the most important thing we help you find accommodation via Airbnb and also calculate the best traveling option, we calculated the distance/price if you go by car or the best fares if you chose to fly.

What else? We offer the possibility to merge with other travelers who share your ideas about a good party. Go together by car, split the fuel, or stay together, share the room and so on, we can help you find these "strangers" for you if you leave Us a contact email.

We used C#, Java, javascript, HTML, CSS,  polymer, deployment on azure platform, with docker.
